Widget designed with the new script widget facility available in LiveCode 10.0 DP5 or higher.
Use the Extension Manager (Tools menu) to install the widget (the .lce file). While possible to 'install' in earlier version of LiveCode it won't work.

After installation an new icon appears in the Tools palette - double click to add to a stack. 

The indicator may occupy the central/defaut position, left or right. This is determined by the switchValue which can be set in the property panel, by clicking on any 3rd of the control or by dragging the indicator. 

The colour of the non-indicator portion changes with each setting and can be set in the PI.
Resize in IDE to change aspect ratio to requirement.
